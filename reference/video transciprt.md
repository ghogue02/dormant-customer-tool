### Video Transcript: Generating an Inactive Customer Sales Report

**[00:00] Travis:** Alright, so here's a quick video that just shows how I run this particular sales report.

**[00:09] Travis:** So, first thing I do is I go into our CRM, and I'm going to run a year's worth of sales data. I'm going to spit it out in CSV.

**[00:17] Travis:** And here's what that CSV is going to look like when it spits out. Uh, let's see here... It's going to look like this.

**[00:28] Travis:** So, I will save this file. Um, one of the challenges is that if we have had changes in the salesperson, all of the data is going to show a customer... so the historical data is going to show the wrong salesperson for that customer.

**[00:47] Travis:** So for example, Mandy White is no longer with the company. Washington Golf and Country Club is now actually an account of Mike Allen's. And so when we run the new report, we have to have the old data, which is not populated with the proper account manager assignment, cleaned, so that this account then goes under Mike Allen instead of Mandy White.

**[01:16] Travis:** So, going into Julius with my reports saved, and I'm going to go into my "Inactive Customer Report" thread. And let's feed it with some data. So... I have to give it, I think, two files. Let's see here. I've got to give it the sales data report, and then I've got to give it a document that has the proper account allocations, which is this one here.

**[01:48] Travis:** Okay. And then I need to ask it to... I think I made the mistake of having this particular thread do a couple of different things, but I think most of it is focused on essentially creating this report.

**[02:16] Travis:** Okay, so I think I've given it the proper prompt. We'll see what it does. But basically asking it to pull all the sales data from the sales report, match the customers up with their proper account manager or sales rep, which is in this report here, on this tab. So, these are the new assignments. For example... Washington Golf and Country Club is Mike Allen's.

**[02:50] Travis:** And then to tell me... to give me a report with a separate tab for each salesperson with the names of customers who ordered in the past six months but have not ordered in the last 45 days. For each of those customers, if you can provide the wines they ordered in 2024 and the net price of each, that would help us in our outreach to those customers.

**[03:15] Travis:** *[The AI tool "Julius" begins processing the request and generating code.]*

**[04:22] Travis:** And so the way that we use this is, the salesperson... this gives them context. All we really want to know, initially, from a sales manager is who hasn't ordered. The name of the customer and the name of the rep, and the last order date. But our salespeople, this helps them so they don't have to look up and say, "What was that customer ordering from us?"

**[04:45] Travis:** Otherwise, they'd have to go through here, go to the customer page... find... Amedeo's... pulling up this, and then looking at their order history, changing it to "item," and doing their own research on an account-by-account and item-by-item basis here, which is just way more manual.

**[05:15] Travis:** So this extra amount of information tells them, you know, what they should ask the customer about or what the customer ordered from us. And then having it consolidated... and basically, we go through and we take a look and say, "Okay, by rep..."

**[05:43] Travis:** *[Shows a pivot table in Excel derived from the data.]* If I had a report that was just Angela and her list of accounts... if I just filtered on this... having this list here is really valuable for our sales manager. So he can go through and say, "Okay, well how many, you know, basically abandoned customers does Angela have? She's got 34. What's the value of the sales that we're potentially losing there?" And then he can manage... you know, is this list getting shorter? Is she going out and handling these dormant accounts?

**[06:35] Travis:** *[Travis opens the final Excel file generated by the AI tool and clicks through the different tabs, each one named for a different salesperson.]*

**[07:05] Travis:** And without going through and doing an entire cleanup here, this looks pretty good. I don't see any reps that are inactive, so that's good. And then I would just do a check. I mean, these look like all of the right accounts. There might be one that's misassigned, but this is a pretty good output.

**[07:24] Travis:** So then, it's just a matter of getting a summary like I was just showing you that has just the account and the last order date and the salesperson, and then what we do...

**[07:41] Travis:** *[Travis switches to a Google Sheet titled "13 Week Goals."]* ...The way we use this information currently, so like, it would be amazing if then at some point... *[He shows another Google Sheet titled "CARLA Mike Allen NOVA."]*.

**[09:07] Travis:** At this point, just having a report that then summarizes it by... I think what it didn't do is it didn't give me... it didn't give me this tab with "All Customers Consolidated" that we could then run this pivot table off of. But I think that gives you an idea as to what we're essentially trying to accomplish is then I would like just this level of data, and probably the last date that they ordered, by account manager, so that we could manage them individually without having all the extra information here.

**[09:51] Travis:** Like for Amaro, I just need one row. I don't need... what do they have? Six, something like that.
