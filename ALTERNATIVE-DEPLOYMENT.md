# Alternative Deployment Options

## Option 1: Deploy Frontend Only (Simplest)

Since the backend processing is simulated anyway, we can deploy just the frontend:

1. **Remove Python dependencies** from vercel.json
2. **Use mock data** for demo purposes
3. **Deploy instantly** without complex setup

## Option 2: Use Netlify Instead

```bash
# Install Netlify CLI
npm install -g netlify-cli

# Deploy to Netlify
netlify deploy --prod
```

Netlify is often more forgiving with build errors.

## Option 3: Local Desktop App

Package it as an Electron app for local use:

```bash
npm install electron --save-dev
# Create electron wrapper
# Package as desktop app
```

## Option 4: Docker Container

```dockerfile
FROM node:18-alpine
WORKDIR /app
COPY . .
RUN npm install
RUN npm run build
EXPOSE 3000
CMD ["npm", "start"]
```

## Option 5: Static Export

Convert to static HTML:

```javascript
// next.config.ts
const nextConfig = {
  output: 'export',
  // ... other config
}
```

Then host on GitHub Pages, S3, or any static host.

## Recommended: Quick Frontend Demo

For immediate results, deploy just the frontend with mock data:

1. Comment out Supabase calls temporarily
2. Use hardcoded demo data
3. Deploy to Vercel/Netlify
4. Add real backend later

This gets you a working demo in minutes!
